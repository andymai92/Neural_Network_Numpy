# Deep learning approach - Neural network with numpy
In this repository, I would like to introduce the basic approach to deep learning and neural network using Numpy. For advanced approach, please refer my Deep_Learning - TensorFlow repository.<br>
### There are two examples with forward/bacward propagations and with Gradient descent algorithm.
